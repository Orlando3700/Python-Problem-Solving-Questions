# Using numpy Library
# If we need to handle large lists or perform more complex
# operations, the numpy library can be helpful. It provides
# a fast way to perform element-wise operations on arrays.

# Import numpy library
import numpy as np

# Input lists
a = [1, 3, 4, 6, 8]
b = [4, 5, 6, 2, 10]

# Convert lists to numpy arrays and add them
# pip install numpy from terminal
#c = np.add(a, b)

# Print the result
# print(c)
